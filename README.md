# Pioneers-Computratum
This was Computatrums entry to the pioneers 'only you can save us' competition.
We made a nerf gun shooting robot.
The first script here is one that allows us to control it with the bluetooth app bluedot.
The other script is for when you are busy and need protection.
Hope you like it,
Computatrum
