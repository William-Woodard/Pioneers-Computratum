# Pioneers-Computratum
This was Computatrums winning entry to the pioneers 'only you can save us' competition.
We made a robot with an attached nerf gun.
The first script here is one that allows us to control it with the bluetooth app bluedot.
The other script is for when you are busy and need protection, it uses a motion sensor.
Hope you like it,
Computatrum
Old project from 2017
